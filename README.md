# getAudio

Using this to quickly "translate" things with Google Translate --> mp3. Uses selenium as a headless browser and stores the generated audio file from the given text (JP for me). You need an options.txt with the first line being your desired output folder (e.g. C:/my/path/audio_files). The selenium chrome driver executable needs to be in the same directory and has to be the same version as Chrome. 

This isn't spruced up at all so just change the code for your use-case lol
